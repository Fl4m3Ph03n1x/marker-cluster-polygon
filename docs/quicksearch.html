In this sample, you can see Portugal divided by its districts, as well as some points of interested marked. When zommed out, the markers are clustered. When zoomed in, the cluster dissipates so you can see each marker individually. InstallDownload all the files (except the docs folder) and make sure you change the API key under index.html to your own: &lt;script src=&quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;This line is in the &lt;head&gt; section and it will define wether or not this demo will work for you or not. UsageTo use it, open the index.html file with a browser of your choice and enjoy. This is mainly a front-end project, so no additional setup is needed. JavaScript CodeThe following files are under the directory js and they represent the logic of this demo: data/poiData.js is the file containing the data for the points of interest. To find the coordinates of a point of interest you can use https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geocoder/ data/districtData.js constains the coordinates that define the district's polygon shape. geometry/coordinate.js representes a coordinate object. geometry/polygon.js represents a polygon object. Contains mathematical calculations for polygons. utils/randomColor.js contains a function to help generete random strings of colors. libs/markermanager.js is my library for managing marker objects from the Google Maps API. myscript.js is responsible for creating the polygons and clustering the marks. Depends on markermanager.js. LicenseThis work is udner the MIT license. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-04-18T12:56:27+00:00 using the DocStrap template. "}}
